## Files

The code will look at the data that is present in the same folder,the data un-compressed  without names altered. The altered data will be merged and tidy up.

CodeBook.md contains variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code used to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. It can be uploaded in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of the 5th step is called Final_data.txt, and uploaded in the course project's form.



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
